# QMolPredict

**Quantum Machine Learning for Molecular Energy Prediction**

QMolPredict is a quantum machine learning framework that predicts ground-state energies of small molecules using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) on PennyLane. It demonstrates how hybrid quantum-classical workflows can accelerate molecular energy computations, with applications in chemistry and drug discovery.
